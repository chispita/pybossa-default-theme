This is the  theme to Socientize for the [Pybossa
server](https://github.com/PyBossa/pybossa).

PyBossa was inspired by the [BOSSA](http://bossa.berkeley.edu/) crowdsourcing engine but is written in
python (hence the name!). It can be used for any distributed tasks application
but was initially developed to help scientists and other researchers
crowd-source human problem-solving skills!
